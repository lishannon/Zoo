        <p> 
            There are four main animals, giant pandas, sloths, kangaroos, and koalas, that can be found here. 
            We hope to bring you all closer to these animals and learn about the animals living. 
            Before you arrive, you can get to know our four animals below by simply clicking on their image. 
            There will be a brief information about them.

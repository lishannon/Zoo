        Kangaroo is Australia’s iconic animal, along with koalas. They are also known as the world’s largest marsupials and hopping animals. They have big feet, a long tail, and short forelimbs. Their big feet allow them to leap and their long tail helps them balance when they land. Surprisingly, kangaroos can’t walk backward. Kangaroos are herbivores that eat different kinds of plants. You will always see them hopping around.
